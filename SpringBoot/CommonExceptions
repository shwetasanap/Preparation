BeanCurrentlyInCreationException:-
It occurs if two or more beans depend on each other directly or indirectly, and Spring cannot
resolve the dependencies using standard constructor or setter injection.
When Spring tries to instantiate A, it needs B, but B also needs A, causing an infinite loop

BeanInitializationException:-
This exception occurs after the bean is instantiated (object created), but before it is fully 
initialized and ready for use in the Spring container.
