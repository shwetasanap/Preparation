Sure! In Spring Boot, loggers are used to record application behavior, which is super helpful for debugging,
monitoring, and understanding what's going on under the hood.

1. What is Logging?

Logging means recording messages during the execution of a program. These messages can be info like:

	•	Errors

	•	Debugging data

	•	General information

	•	Warnings

2. Default Logger in Spring Boot

Spring Boot uses SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) as an abstraction and typically uses Logback as the default 
underlying implementation.

That means:

	•	You write logs using SLF4J (interface)

	•	Logback does the actual logging (implementation)

What it is:
SLF4J is a logging facade (interface/abstraction) for various logging frameworks in Java.
What it does:
It allows developers to write logging code without being tied to a specific logging implementation (like Logback, Log4j,
or java.util.logging).
How it works:
You code against the SLF4J API. At runtime, SLF4J binds to the actual logging framework via a binding JAR.
Why it’s useful:
You can switch logging implementations (e.g., from Logback to Log4j) without changing your application code.

3. Logger Example

Here’s a simple example:

import org.slf4j.Logger;

import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController

public class MyController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyController.class);

    @GetMapping("/hello")

    public String hello() {

        logger.info("INFO log message");

        logger.debug("DEBUG log message");

        logger.warn("WARN log message");

        logger.error("ERROR log message");

        return "Hello World";

    }

}

4. Log Levels (in increasing order of severity)

	•	TRACE – most detailed

	•	DEBUG

	•	INFO

	•	WARN

	•	ERROR

5. Setting Log Levels

You can configure log levels in application.properties or application.yml:

application.properties:

logging.level.root=INFO

logging.level.com.myapp=DEBUG

application.yml:

logging:

  level:

    root: INFO

    com.myapp: DEBUG

6. Changing the Logging Format

You can also change the format, log file location, and more:

# Write logs to a file

logging.file.name=app.log

logging.file.path=/var/logs

# Change log pattern

logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n

7. Common Alternatives

While Logback is default, Spring Boot also supports:

	•	Log4j2

	•	Java Util Logging (JUL)

If you want to switch, just exclude Logback and include the one you want.

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into log rotation, custom appenders, or async logging. 
Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of log levels in logging frameworks like Logback (used in Spring Boot).
These levels control what kind of messages get logged, based on severity and importance.

Log Levels (in order of severity):

1. TRACE

	•	Most detailed level.

	•	Used for fine-grained information about the flow of a program.

	•	Great for deep debugging — like method entry/exit, loop iterations, etc.

Example:

logger.trace("Starting calculation with inputs: {}, {}", a, b);

2. DEBUG

	•	Used for debugging information.

	•	Less verbose than TRACE, but still gives internal state and flow insights.

Example:

logger.debug("User retrieved from DB: {}", user);

3. INFO

	•	General information about application behavior.

	•	Use it for important application events — like startup, shutdown, business milestones.

Example:

logger.info("Application started on port 8080");

4. WARN

	•	Indicates a potential problem or something unexpected.

	•	Doesn't stop the application, but it's worth investigating.

Example:

logger.warn("User tried to access deprecated API: /v1/old-endpoint");

5. ERROR

	•	Serious issue that has caused an operation to fail.

	•	Application might still run, but this should be fixed ASAP.

Example:

logger.error("Unable to connect to database", exception);

When to Use What?

Log Level

Use Case

TRACE

Very detailed debugging. Only use in development.

DEBUG

Useful debug info, safe for dev or QA.

INFO

High-level app events. OK for production.

WARN

Something unexpected, but not fatal. Monitor it.

ERROR

Something failed. Needs attention.

Controlling Log Levels

You can set the minimum log level for different packages:

# Root level

logging.level.root=INFO

# Custom package

logging.level.com.myapp.service=DEBUG

So if INFO is the current level, DEBUG or TRACE logs won't be shown.
