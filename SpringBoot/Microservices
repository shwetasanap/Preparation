HTTP methods in REST architecture define the type of operations performed on resources. The most commonly used methods are:

GET: Retrieves data from a server. It's idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests have the same effect as one.

Example: Fetching a list of users.
POST: Sends data to the server to create a new resource.

Example: Creating a new user.
PUT: Updates an existing resource entirely. Also idempotent.

Example: Replacing a user's profile data.
PATCH: Partially updates an existing resource.

Example: Modifying only the user's email.
DELETE: Removes a resource from the server.

Example: Deleting a user account.
HEAD: Similar to GET but only retrieves metadata (headers) without the body content.

OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP methods for a specific URL or resource.

Each method in REST corresponds to actions in CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. REST relies on stateless communication, and HTTP methods standardize how clients interact with resources.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************


HTTP status codes in REST architecture provide feedback about the result of the request made by the client. These codes are grouped into five categories, based on their first digit:

--> 1xx: Informational
These codes indicate that the request has been received and is being processed.

100 Continue: The server has received the initial part of the request and the client should continue with the rest.
101 Switching Protocols: The server is switching to a different protocol as requested by the client.
--> 2xx: Success
These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

200 OK: The request was successful, and the response body contains the requested resource.
Example: A successful GET or POST.
201 Created: A new resource was successfully created.
Example: After a successful POST request that creates a new resource.
202 Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing, but the process has not been completed.
Example: Long-running asynchronous requests.
204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no response body (useful for DELETE operations).
Example: A successful DELETE with no content returned.

--> 3xx: Redirection
These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request, often involving redirection.

301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been moved to a new URL permanently.
302 Found: The resource is temporarily located elsewhere (often used for URL redirection).
304 Not Modified: The resource has not been modified since the last request, so the client can use the cached version.

--> 4xx: Client Errors
These codes indicate that there was a problem with the client's request.

400 Bad Request: The request is invalid, usually due to malformed syntax or missing required parameters.
Example: Sending incorrect JSON data.
401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required, but the client failed to provide valid credentials.
Example: Missing or invalid authentication token.
403 Forbidden: The client is authenticated but does not have permission to access the requested resource.
Example: Trying to delete a resource without the right permissions.
404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist.
Example: Accessing a non-existent endpoint.
405 Method Not Allowed: The request method is not supported for the requested resource.
Example: Trying to DELETE on a resource that only supports GET.
409 Conflict: The request conflicts with the current state of the resource.
Example: Attempting to create a resource that already exists.
422 Unprocessable Entity: The server understands the request, but the content is invalid or cannot be processed.
Example: Failing validation rules in a POST request.

--> 5xx: Server Errors
These codes indicate that there was a server-side problem while processing the request.

500 Internal Server Error: A generic error occurred on the server.
Example: Unhandled exception in the server-side code.
502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server while acting as a gateway or proxy.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unavailable (usually due to overload or maintenance).
504 Gateway Timeout: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

In REST APIs, these status codes help communicate the result of the client's action. They provide meaningful feedback, allowing clients to handle responses correctly. For example:

A successful GET request might return a 200 OK.
A successful resource creation might return 201 Created.
A failed request due to validation errors might return 400 Bad Request or 422 Unprocessable Entity.

Response Types :-

In RESTful web services, the response types refer to the formats in which the server sends data back to the client after processing 
a request. These formats are specified using MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types in the Content-Type and Accept headers,
ensuring the client and server can communicate effectively and interpret data consistently.



Here are the most common response types used in RESTful APIs:

1. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    MIME Type: application/json
    Description: JSON is the most commonly used format in REST APIs due to its simplicity and ease of use. 
    It represents data as key-value pairs and is easy to parse for both humans and machines.
2. XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
    MIME Type: application/xml or text/xml
    Description: XML was widely used before JSON became the dominant format. It uses tags to structure data 
    in a hierarchical format. While not as lightweight as JSON, it can represent more complex relationships and metadata.
3. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
    MIME Type: text/html
    Description: While not common for APIs, HTML is sometimes used in REST responses for web-based applications,
    especially when returning rendered content, such as error pages.
4. Plain Text
    MIME Type: text/plain
    Description: This format is used for returning plain, unformatted text. It is often used for simple responses or error messages.
