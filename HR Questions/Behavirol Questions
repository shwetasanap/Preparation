1. Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult team member. What was the outcome?
-->
In a previous project, I worked with a team member who often missed deadlines and seemed unresponsive to feedback. 
This affected our team’s progress and morale. I decided to approach the situation empathetically and set up a one-on-one conversation
to understand if there were any underlying issues. During our discussion, I learned that they were struggling with some of the technical
aspects of the project and felt uncomfortable asking for help.

I offered to support them by reviewing certain tasks together and encouraged them to communicate more openly with the team. 
Over time, their performance improved and they became more engaged. As a result, our team collaboration strengthened and we were 
able to complete the project successfully. The experience taught me the importance of communication, empathy, and proactive
problem-solving when working with diverse personalities.


2.Give an example of a goal you set and how you achieved it.
-->
I wanted to improve my time management skills at work. To do this, I started creating a daily to-do list with my top priorities.
I made sure to check off each task as I completed it. After a few weeks, I noticed I was able to finish my work on time and felt 
less stressed. This small change really helped me become more organized and productive.


3.Have you ever made a mistake on a project? How did you address it?
-->
Yes, I have made mistakes in projects before. For example, I once misunderstood part of a client’s requirements and worked on the
wrong feature. As soon as I realized the mistake, I informed my manager and the team. I took responsibility and quickly corrected 
the issue by updating the feature to match the client’s needs. I also double-checked requirements with the client going forward 
to make sure it didn’t happen again. The project was delivered on time, and I learned the importance of clear communication and
asking questions when things aren’t clear.

4.Tell me about a time you had to quickly adapt to a major change at work.
-->
We had a sudden requirement to add security to our Spring Boot application using Spring Security. 
I had never used Spring Security before, so I quickly read the documentation and watched a few tutorials.
I tried out different configurations in a test project and, with some help from my teammates, was able to 
set up authentication and authorization in our application within a few days. This experience helped me become 
comfortable with learning new Spring Boot modules under tight deadlines.


5.How do you prioritize your tasks when you have multiple deadlines?
-->
When I have multiple deadlines, I start by making a list of all my tasks and their due dates.
I rank them by urgency and importance, and focus on the highest-priority tasks first. 
I also break down big tasks into smaller steps and set mini-deadlines for myself to stay on track. 
If needed, I communicate with my team or manager to make sure I’m focusing on the right priorities.

6.Give an example of how you handled receiving constructive criticism
-->
When I received constructive criticism about my coding style, I took it positively and reviewed the feedback. 
I asked for specific examples and made changes to my code. As a result, my code became cleaner and easier for my team to read.

7.Tell me about a project where you took the initiative. What did you do and what was the result?
-->

On a previous team, I noticed our project documentation was outdated and causing confusion for new members.
I took the initiative to update all the documentation, including setting up a new onboarding guide.
I coordinated with teammates to make sure the information was accurate.
As a result, new team members were able to get up to speed much faster and team productivity improved.

8.Describe a time when you went above and beyond your job responsibilities.
-->
In my previous role, a teammate unexpectedly went on leave right before a big project deadline.
Although it wasn’t part of my core responsibilities, I volunteered to take on their tasks in addition to my own. 
I worked extra hours to ensure both sets of work were completed on time, and the project was delivered successfully.
My manager appreciated my dedication and teamwork.


While working as a developer, I noticed frequent bugs in our deployment process that weren’t officially my responsibility to fix.
I took the initiative to investigate, documented the issues, and created a set of scripts to automate deployment checks.
This reduced errors and improved our release process, earning positive feedback from both the development and operations teams.

9.Strength/Weakness
-->
Certainly! Here are concise examples of strengths and weaknesses you can mention in an interview:

**Strengths:**
- Quick learner
- Strong problem-solving skills
- Effective communicator
- Team player
- Detail-oriented
- Adaptable to change

**Weaknesses:**
- Sometimes overly critical of my own work
- Can be a perfectionist
- Tendency to take on too many tasks at once
- Public speaking nerves (but improving)
- Delegating tasks can be challenging

**Strength**

**Strength:** Adaptability  
**Explanation:** I am able to adjust quickly to new situations, technologies, and changes in the workplace.  
**Example:**  
_In my previous job, our team had to switch to a new project management tool on short notice.
I took the initiative to learn the tool, attended online tutorials, and then helped train my teammates. 
Because of my quick adaptation, our team was able to continue working efficiently without missing any deadlines._

**Weakness**

**Weakness:** Tendency to be a perfectionist  
**Explanation:** I sometimes spend too much time making sure my work is perfect, which can slow down my productivity.  
**Example:**  
_When preparing client presentations, I used to double-check everything multiple times to ensure there were no errors.
While this led to high-quality work, it also meant I sometimes missed tight deadlines.
I’ve since learned to balance quality with efficiency by setting time limits for myself and trusting my initial work more._
