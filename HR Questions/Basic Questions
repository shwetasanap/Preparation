"As a Java Developer on the Spring Boot project, I contributed in several important areas:

Building and Designing APIs: I helped design and build the RESTful APIs using Spring Boot. I made sure that the APIs were efficient, easy to use, and well-structured.

Database Integration: I worked with Spring Data JPA to connect the application to the database. I created and optimized database queries to ensure fast and accurate data retrieval.

Security: I set up security features using Spring Security, including user authentication and authorization. This made sure only the right users could access sensitive parts of the application.

Writing Tests: I wrote unit and integration tests to ensure that the application was reliable and bug-free. I used JUnit and Mockito to test different parts of the system.

4. Notice period :-

My company is transitioning from a startup to a service-based model, and as part of this shift, 
the notice period was extended from 30 days to 90 days to align with industry standards and ensure smoother transitions.

i am also open to negotiate an early release based on discussions with my current employer.
