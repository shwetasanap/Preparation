**Requirement gathering** is **one of the most critical phases** of any project—whether it's software development, marketing, operations, or construction. Here's **why it matters so much**:

---

### ✅ 1. **Sets a Clear Foundation**
- It defines **what the project is meant to achieve**.
- Without clearly defined requirements, teams can go off-track fast, building something the client or end-user **doesn’t actually want**.

**Example:** Imagine building an app and finding out at launch that the client wanted offline access—but it was never discussed!

---

### ✅ 2. **Reduces Rework & Saves Time**
- When requirements are clear from the start, it reduces the chances of **costly changes** later.
- Fixing issues during or after development is way more expensive than getting it right from the beginning.

---

### ✅ 3. **Improves Communication**
- It ensures that **stakeholders, project managers, and developers** are all on the same page.
- It also helps manage **expectations**—everyone knows what will (and won’t) be delivered.

---

### ✅ 4. **Helps with Accurate Planning & Estimation**
- Requirements influence your:
  - **Timeline**
  - **Budget**
  - **Resources**
- Without them, planning is based on guesses, not facts.

---

### ✅ 5. **Drives Project Success**
- Most project failures stem from **poor or incomplete requirements**.
- Good requirements = higher chance of delivering something that solves the actual problem.

---

### 💬 In Summary:
> “If you don’t know where you're going, any road will get you there.”  
> — Requirements gathering makes sure you're headed in the **right** direction, with a **map** and a **purpose**.

Out of box thinking

Meetings productivity less so keep neeting on specific timings
issues solving sessions on fridays

when issue occurs how you tackle
Great question! Here’s a simple but effective way to explain **how you tackle issues** in a software development project (or any project) during an interview:

---

### **Answer:**

**"When an issue occurs, my first step is to stay calm and assess the situation. I prioritize understanding the root cause rather than just the symptoms.
I gather all the necessary information from the team or stakeholders, and then I break the problem down into manageable parts.**

**Next, I communicate with the team, discuss potential solutions, and decide on the best course of action.
If it’s something technical, I’ll collaborate with the engineers to find a fix. For larger issues, I escalate the
problem to the relevant stakeholders with a clear plan. Once we’ve implemented the solution, I make sure to review what happened,
document the findings, and put measures in place to avoid similar issues in the future."**

---

how you take feedback from other people

Sure! Here's a **simple and concise** version tailored to a **software company**:

---

### **Answer:**

**"When I receive feedback, I listen carefully and make sure I fully understand it by asking questions if needed.
I reflect on how I can improve based on the feedback, especially when it comes to code quality or development practices.
I apply the feedback right away and make the necessary changes. Afterward, I check in with the person who gave the feedback 
to make sure it met their expectations. This helps me improve and keeps communication open."**

why mastercard

In summary, Mastercard is more service-based in its approach, offering solutions that enable secure and efficient payment systems.
But they do offer physical products, like their branded cards, which serve as a means to access their payment network.

I’m excited about the opportunity to join Mastercard because of its leadership in innovative payment solutions and its commitment 
to financial inclusion. I’m passionate about working in a company that leverages cutting-edge technology to solve real-world problems,
and I believe my skills in [mention relevant skills/experience] align well with the impactful work Mastercard is doing. I’m eager to 
contribute to a global leader and grow in such a dynamic environment."





About my work :-



I was involved in developing the loan application dashboard, where I implemented dynamic filters to help users 
easily search and track loan applications. I also worked on the sanctions module, which involved designing workflows
 for multi-level approvals from higher authorities, ensuring compliance and proper authorization.
As part of the process, I integrated FCU (Field Credit Unit) activities into the application for verification 
and fraud checks. I also contributed to Master Data Management, allowing users to manage and update master records 
through the UI with proper validations and audit tracking.
In the loan decisioning section, I implemented appropriate design patterns to handle different types of loans efficiently. 
This module had around 12 different stages, and I ensured smooth transitions and logic flow across all stages based on the type of loan.
Apart from these, I contributed significantly to code enhancements by writing several small utility APIs, as well as 
RESTful services to communicate with other internal services for tasks like fetching loan status, customer data, and approval history.

Behavioral Questions:
Prepare to answer questions about your experience with Spring Boot projects, challenges you've faced, and how you've overcome them. 
Be prepared to discuss your problem-solving approach, communication skills, and teamwork abilities. 
Understand Mastercard's core values and culture. 


"My strengths are attention to detail, taking ownership, and quick learning. I ensure code quality and am proactive about resolving issues.
A weakness I’ve been working on is overthinking solutions initially — I now involve others early through design discussions to balance perfection with practicality."
