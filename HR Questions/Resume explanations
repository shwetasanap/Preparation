Facilitated seamless communication between front-end and back-end services by building and consuming RESTful APIs,
optimizing data exchange, and boosting application responsiveness by 25%.

The 25% improvement in application responsiveness was calculated by measuring the average response time before and after
optimizing the communication between the front-end and back-end services. By streamlining API calls, minimizing API calls for each user 
actions,
reducing payload sizes, and optimizing data processing, we achieved a measurable reduction in response time.
The 25% figure reflects the percentage decrease in time it takes for the application to respond to user requests
post-optimization, calculated by comparing the pre- and post-optimization response times.

Modernized legacy Java code using design patterns such as Factory, Singleton, and Builder, enhancing maintainability,
readability, and reducing bug rates by 35%.



Refactor the legacy code using design patterns like Factory, Singleton, and Builder. These patterns help by creating more modular, 
reusable, and testable code, making it easier to maintain and debug.
Measure Post-Modernization Bug Rate:

After implementing the design patterns, monitor the number of bugs over the same time period or under similar conditions. 
Let’s say the bug count dropped to 65 from 100.
Calculate the Percentage Reduction:

Use the following formula to calculate the percentage reduction in bugs:
Percentage Reduction=Pre-Modernization Bugs−Post-Modernization Bugs/Pre-Modernization Bugs × 100

Implemented AWS S3 buckets for secure, cost-effective storage and efficient management of sensitive data, reducing data
retrieval time by 30%.


S3 uses a distributed architecture, ensuring that data is stored across multiple availability zones and can be accessed from different 
locations. This helps reduce latency and improves access times.

AWS S3 can support parallel requests, meaning that multiple users or systems can access data at the same time without performance degradation. 
This is in contrast to systems that may become slower as the number of users increases.

Led the design, development, and maintenance of scalable, high-performance Java-based microservices using Spring Boot
with Java 11 and 17, resulting in a 35% increase in system scalability.



Adopting Spring Boot: Spring Boot provides a lightweight, flexible framework that simplifies the development and deployment of microservices.
It also comes with built-in features like auto-scaling, health checks, and easy integration with container orchestration systems 
like Kubernetes, which helps in scaling microservices efficiently.

Upgrading Java Versions: Migrating to Java 11 or Java 17 can improve performance because these newer versions come with 
optimizations, better memory management, faster garbage collection, and improved JVM performance, all of which contribute to scalability.

Factors to consider :-

Response Time: Check if the system can maintain acceptable response times as traffic increases.
Throughput: Measure the number of requests the system can handle per second or minute without performance degradation.
Error Rate: Monitor if the error rate increases as the load increases.

Do this for before and after implementation.
