Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software.
It is a widely adopted tool in the field of DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).


Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

Jenkins enables developers to integrate their code into a shared repository multiple times a day.
Automated builds and tests are triggered for every code change, ensuring that code is always in a deployable state.(CI)
Make sure that every new change made should be deployed.(CD)

How Jenkins Works:

Job Configuration:

A "job" in Jenkins defines the steps to build, test, and deploy an application. 
Jobs can be configured through the Jenkins UI, or written as code in the form of pipelines.

Triggers:

Jenkins jobs can be triggered automatically by various events, such as code commits, schedule-based triggers (CRON),
or even manual triggers.

Build Execution:

Jenkins pulls the latest code from a version control system (like Git), builds the application, and runs tests. 
If the build or tests fail, Jenkins provides detailed logs to help developers debug the issue.

Notification:

Jenkins can notify teams about the build status via email, Slack, or other communication tools.

Deployment:

After successful builds, Jenkins can deploy the application to a staging or production environment.

JOB creation:

Create a file named Jenkinsfile in your project's repository. An example pipeline might look like this:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the project...'
                // Add build commands here
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                // Add test commands here
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
                // Add deployment commands here
            }
        }
    }
}
