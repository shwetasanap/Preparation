1) Stack and heap memory

----> Stack Memory in Java
Stored in computer RAM
In Java, Stack Memory is a special region on the memory where the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) keeps track of method execution.

Stack Memory in Java is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread. 
It contains primitive values that are specific to a method and references to objects referred from the method that are in a heap.

Access to this memory is in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. Whenever we call a new method, a new block is created on top of 
the stack which contains values specific to that method, like primitive variables and references to objects.

When the method finishes execution, its corresponding stack frame is flushed, the flow goes back to the calling method, and space becomes available for the next method.
If this memory is full, Java throws java.lang.StackOverFlowError.


----> Heap Memory in Java
Heap Memory facilitates Dynamic Memory Allocation for Java objects and JRE classes during program execution.
Objects in the heap have global access, available from any part of the application.

 Differenc
---> Java Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack is only used for the method — or methods — currently running.

2) Static keyword

Used with method , variables and class
In  case of multiple blocks then they will execute in the order they are defined.
That’s the reason, values initialized by first block are overwritten by second block.


In Java, the main difference between static variables, static methods, and static classes 
is that static variables and methods are associated with a class, while a static class is a class type


A static variable is instantiated once, a static method can be called from a class without instantiating 
an instance of the class, a static class cannot be instantiated. 


******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
3) System.out.println() and  System.err.println() 

System: It is a final class defined in the java.lang package.
out: This is an instance of PrintStream type, which is a public and static member field of the System class.
println(): As all instances of the PrintStream class have a public method println(), we can invoke the same on out as well. 
This is an upgraded version of print(). It prints any argument passed to it and adds a new line to the output. 
We can assume that System.out represents the Standard Output Stream.


System.out.println() will print to the standard out of the system.	              System.err.println() will print to the standard error.
System.out.println() is mostly used to display results on the console.	          System.err.println( is mostly used to output error texts.
It gives output on the console with the default(black) color.	                    It also gives output on the console but most of the IDEs give it a red color to differentiate.


******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

4) stack or heap memory is cleared in the garbage collection
Garbage Collection runs on the heap memory to free the memory used by objects that don't have any reference. 

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

5) Java supports several key object-oriented programming (OOP) features:

---> Encapsulation: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. 
Access to the data is restricted to methods within the class, often using access modifiers (private, public, protected).

---> Inheritance: The ability to create a new class (subclass) that inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class
(superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

---> Polymorphism: The ability to treat objects of different classes that share a common superclass as objects of that superclass.
This includes method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (subclass providing a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass).

---> Abstraction: The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. 
This is often achieved using abstract classes and interfaces, allowing you to define methods that must be implemented by 
subclasses without specifying how they should be implemented.

---> Classes and Objects: Java uses classes as blueprints to create objects. An object is an instance of a class, and it encapsulates 
both data and behavior.

---> Method Overriding: A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
This is a key aspect of achieving polymorphism.

---> Interfaces: Java allows the definition of interfaces, which are contracts that classes can implement.
An interface can contain abstract methods (without implementation) and constants, promoting a way to achieve abstraction and
multiple inheritance.

6) Diamond problem and it's solution 

The "diamond problem" in Java arises when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass, 
creating an ambiguous situation regarding which superclass's methods or properties should be used. This is particularly 
relevant in languages that support multiple inheritance, like C++, but Java handles this differently.


Sol-1 :-  Single inheritance
sol-2 :- use interfaces

Referring to Default Methods: When a class implements multiple interfaces that have the same default method, super allows 
the class to specify which interface's implementation to invoke.

Syntax: The syntax InterfaceName.super.methodName() is used to call a default method from a specific interface.
In this case, Car.super.start(); calls the start() method defined in the Car interface.

E.g. :- 

interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

interface Car {
    default void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting.");
    }
}

interface Motorcycle {
    default void start() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle is starting.");
    }
}

class HybridVehicle implements Car, Motorcycle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        // Resolve ambiguity by explicitly calling one of the default methods
        Car.super.start(); // or Motorcycle.super.start();
        System.out.println("HybridVehicle is starting.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HybridVehicle hv = new HybridVehicle();
        hv.start();
    }
}

12) what is the purpose of java.util.concurrent package

The package includes thread-safe variants of commonly used collections, such as:

ConcurrentHashMap: A thread-safe version of HashMap that allows concurrent access and modifications without blocking the entire map.


It provides several synchronization constructs, such as:

Locks: The Lock interface and its implementations (like ReentrantLock) offer more flexible locking mechanisms than the traditional
synchronized methods/blocks.

Condition Variables: Condition objects allow threads to wait for specific conditions and notify others when conditions change, 
enhancing the synchronization capabilities.

15) Difference between thread and process


Threads and processes are fundamental concepts in operating systems and concurrent programming, 
but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

16) Synchronized and volatile keyword :-

The synchronized modifier is only for methods and blocks not for variables and classes. Synchronized keyword comes into the picture when multiple threads are trying to get access to the same java object simultaneously. A synchronized block or method allows only one thread at a time to execute on a given object, which will solve the problem of data inconsistency.
To use synchronized keywords in Java we have two ways 1) Synchronized method 2) Synchronized block


A volatile keyword is a field modifier that provides a visibility guarantee. Java uses volatile as an indicator to the Java compiler and thread that does not cache the value of this variable and always reads it from the main memory. The volatile keyword is only used with variables not with methods or classes.

Example:-

class Test
{
boolean flag = true;
}
In the above example, suppose two threads are working on the same class. Both threads run on different processors where each thread has its local copy of the flag. And if any thread changes the value of the flag, in the main memory the value will not get reflected and because the other threads are not aware of the changed value it will lead to data inconsistency.

class Test
{
volatile boolean flag = true;
}
In the above example, we have declared the flag as volatile so that the value of the variable will never be stored in the cache. And all the read and write operations will be done from and to the main memory.

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

17) Priority of threads in java 

Every Java thread has a priority that helps the operating system determine the order in which threads are scheduled. 
You can get and set the priority of a Thread.

MIN_PRIORITY: Specifies the minimum priority that a thread can have. 1

NORM_PRIORITY: Specifies the default priority that a thread is assigned. 5

MAX_PRIORITY: Specifies the maximum priority that a thread can have. 10

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

18) Context switching in java

Thread Context Switch is a process of switching the working from one thread to another. The computer CPU stores the state of current 
thread, so that it can be retured later. Next it switches to the next thread, picks it where it was left before, and continuous to 
start working.

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

19) sleep() and wait()

While the sleep() function is time-dependent and doesn't need any notice, the wait() method is time-independent and requires
notification from another thread. 

sleep --> does not releases lock on resource  
wait --> releases lock on resource
