String Immutability:

In many programming languages, strings are immutable, meaning once created, their values cannot be changed.
This makes them ideal for optimization, as the same string value can be reused in different parts of a program.

String Pool in Java:

In Java, the String Pool is a special area in memory (often part of the heap or method area) where all the unique string literals are stored. 
When you create a string using a string literal (e.g., "Hello"), Java checks the pool to see if the exact string already exists.
If it does, the reference to the existing string is returned instead of creating a new object. This saves memory and improves performance.

How It Works:

When you create a string using a string literal (e.g., "Hello"), Java first checks the pool to see if the string "Hello" already exists.
If it does, it simply returns the reference to the existing string.
If it doesn't exist, Java creates a new string object, adds it to the pool, and returns the reference.
The pool is designed to store only unique strings; no two strings with the same value will be stored separately.

You can manually add strings to the pool using the intern() method:
intern() ensures that if the string is already in the pool, it will return the reference from the pool. Otherwise, it will add the string to the pool.


Benefits:

Memory Optimization: By reusing string values from the pool, memory consumption is reduced since identical strings arenâ€™t duplicated.
Performance Improvement: Searching for and comparing string references in the pool is faster than comparing string objects.

Drawbacks:

Memory overhead for the pool: The string pool can grow in size, which might become a concern in memory-limited environments, especially if there are a lot of unique strings.
Not all strings are pooled: Strings created at runtime (using new String(), for instance) will not automatically be added to the pool unless explicitly interned.
