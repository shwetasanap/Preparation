PostgreSQL, often shortened to "Postgres", is an advanced, open-source, object-relational database management system
(ORDBMS) known for its reliability, flexibility, and adherence to SQL standards. 


A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships. 
These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows.
A relational database management system is software that lets you read, write, and modify the relational database. 
PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDMBS), which means that it has relational
capabilities and an object-oriented design.

Using object-oriented features of PostgreSQL, programmers can:

Communicate with the database servers using objects in their code.
Define complex custom data types.
Define functions that work with their own data types.
Define inheritance, or parent-child relationships, between tables.
Thus, PostgreSQL design is more flexible than other relational database servers. 
You can model different relationships and types within the existing database system
instead of externally in your application code. You can maintain consistency and improve 
database performance by enforcing intended behavior closer to the actual data.
