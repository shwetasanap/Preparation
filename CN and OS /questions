Great! Since you have 3 years of experience as a developer and are preparing for an Amazon interview, I'll explain **Operating System (OS) concepts** in a way that’s both **simple and deep enough** for interview preparation. We'll focus on the most **commonly asked OS topics** and concepts that Amazon and similar companies tend to focus on in system design and coding interviews.

---

### 🔧 1. **Processes and Threads**

#### 🧠 Basic Idea:

* A **process** is a running program (like Chrome or VS Code).
* A **thread** is a smaller unit of execution inside a process.

#### ✅ Key Points:

* A process has **its own memory space**.
* Threads share memory **within the same process**, making communication faster, but also riskier (race conditions).

#### 🔥 Interview Tip:

Know how to create threads, and the difference between **multitasking (multiple processes)** and **multithreading (multiple threads)**.

---

### ⚙️ 2. **CPU Scheduling**

#### 🧠 Basic Idea:

The OS decides **which process/thread gets the CPU** and for how long.

#### ✅ Key Scheduling Algorithms:

* **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
* **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
* **Round Robin (RR)** – used in time-sharing systems.
* **Priority Scheduling**

#### 🔥 Interview Tip:

Understand **context switching**, **CPU burst vs I/O burst**, and **how these algorithms affect performance** (e.g., response time, throughput).

---

### 💾 3. **Memory Management**

#### 🧠 Basic Idea:

The OS manages RAM and decides where programs are loaded and how memory is allocated.

#### ✅ Key Concepts:

* **Paging**: Break memory into fixed-size blocks.
* **Segmentation**: Break memory into logical segments (code, stack, heap).
* **Virtual Memory**: Use disk as extra RAM using **swap** or **page files**.
* **Page Replacement Algorithms**: FIFO, LRU (Least Recently Used), etc.

#### 🔥 Interview Tip:

Be able to explain **page faults**, **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**, and how virtual memory works under the hood.

---

### 📂 4. **File Systems**

#### 🧠 Basic Idea:

The OS handles reading/writing from storage (files, directories).

#### ✅ Key Concepts:

* File structure (flat vs hierarchical)
* File allocation methods: contiguous, linked, indexed
* Access permissions (read, write, execute)

#### 🔥 Interview Tip:

Know how files are stored, accessed, and locked (e.g., what happens during simultaneous access).

---

### 📦 5. **Concurrency & Synchronization**

#### 🧠 Basic Idea:

Managing **multiple processes/threads** running at the same time safely.

#### ✅ Key Tools:

* **Mutex / Lock**: Allows only one thread access at a time.
* **Semaphore**: Like a lock but allows multiple threads (used for controlling access to resources).
* **Deadlock**: When two or more threads are waiting for each other forever.

#### 🔥 Interview Tip:

Understand:

* The 4 conditions of a **deadlock**.
* How to prevent it: **Banker’s algorithm**, **resource hierarchy**, **timeouts**.

---

### 📚 6. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**

#### 🧠 Basic Idea:

Mechanism for processes to communicate and synchronize.

#### ✅ Common Techniques:

* Pipes
* Message Queues
* Shared Memory
* Sockets

#### 🔥 Interview Tip:

You should know **when to use which IPC mechanism**, especially in distributed system or client-server apps.

---

### 📤 7. **I/O and Device Management**

#### 🧠 Basic Idea:

The OS handles communication between hardware devices (keyboard, disk) and software.

#### ✅ Key Concepts:

* Device drivers
* Interrupts
* Buffers and caching

---

### 🔐 8. **Security and Protection**

#### 🧠 Basic Idea:

OS must protect processes from each other, and restrict access to hardware.

#### ✅ Key Concepts:

* User mode vs Kernel mode
* Access control (ACLs, capabilities)
* System calls

---

### 🧪 Practice Questions for Interviews:

1. What’s the difference between a process and a thread?
2. How does virtual memory work?
3. Explain how LRU page replacement algorithm works.
4. Describe how deadlock occurs. How can it be prevented?
5. Explain how Round Robin scheduling works and its tradeoffs.
6. How do two processes communicate in Linux?
7. How does the OS know which process to schedule next?

---

### 📌 Tips for Amazon Interview:

* Use real-life analogies (e.g., "process is like a restaurant, thread is like a waiter").
* Know your programming language’s threading model (e.g., Java's `Thread`, Python's GIL).
* Practice system design questions involving concurrency (e.g., building a rate limiter, task scheduler).

Would you like me to create **flashcards**, **diagrams**, or **sample coding questions** (like implementing mutex, or simulating scheduling)?
