A **computer network** is a collection of computers and other devices (such as printers, servers, routers, etc.) 
that are connected together to share resources, exchange data, and communicate with each other.
These connections can be made using cables (wired) or wireless signals (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.).

### Key Points:
- Enables sharing of data, files, and hardware (like printers).
- Allows communication through emails, messaging, and applications.
- Can range from small (like a home network) to very large (like the internet).

**Examples:**
- A Local Area Network (LAN) in an office.
- The Internet, which connects millions of computers worldwide.

**In summary:**  
A computer network allows devices to connect and communicate, making resource sharing and collaboration possible.
